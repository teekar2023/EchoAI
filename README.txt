EchoAI Takes A Minute Or Two To Start Up Sometimes So Please Be Patient! (I Am Working On A Fix For This)

EchoAI is a simple AI with machine learning that has basic functions! More functions, such as a timer, and maybe even a graphing calculator of some sort is coming soon!

Please email me (sree23palla@gmail.com) for Help, Bug Reports, Or Suggestions!

Python Version: 3.8

Thank You For Trying EchoAI!
